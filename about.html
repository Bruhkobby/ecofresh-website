            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>EcoFresh was born from a simple belief: keeping your home clean shouldn't come at the cost of our planet's health. We're a team of environmental advocates, chemists, and everyday people who wanted better options for our families and our world.</p>
            
            <p>Founded in 2020, we set out to create cleaning products that work as well as traditional cleaners but without the harmful chemicals, toxic fumes, or environmental damage. Every product we make is crafted with care, using plant-based ingredients that are powerful, safe, and sustainable.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe that small changes make a big difference. Our mission is to make eco-friendly cleaning accessible to everyone by creating products that are effective, affordable, and kind to the planet. We're committed to transparency in our ingredients, sustainability in our practices, and excellence in our results.</p>
